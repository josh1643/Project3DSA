TO USE TRANSLATION HASHMAP!!!


Commands

load (file path) (line count)
	To load full file put 0 for line count, excludes any lines with more than two commas cuz yeah
clear
	Empties the translation map
info
	Gives info on the translation map and translation loader
add (phrase) (translation)
	Adds a node to the translation map
find (phrase)
	Finds a phrase and returns the translation
list (count)
	Lists the first count indexes of the translation map
quit
	Quits :p



Additionally you can load a file on start up by specifiying the file path and count as command line args when running the program
Works the same as the load command
